First repository, a collection of ideas

Kristian here, currently (as of July 12th 2019) studying for a PhD in Vision Science at Cardiff University
Hence the learning to code and git. Mostly using Matlab for psychophysical testing and data collection,
but also using R for some testing (utilising Open Perimetry Interface) and statistical analysis.
Likes: Music, long walks on the beach, and user-input variables.
